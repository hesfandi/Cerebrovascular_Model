# Cerebrovascular_Model
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for the in-silico design and simulation of a segmented cerebrovascular model, as described in "Depth-Dependent Contributions of Various Vascular Zones to Cerebral Autoregulation and Functional Hyperemia." The framework provides a platform for in-silico exploring the cerebral blood flow regulatory system.
